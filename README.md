# PRODIGY_GA_3

> Implement a simple text generation algorithm using Markov chains. This task involves creating a model that predicts the probability of a character or word based on the previous one(s).
## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The program reads a training text file (`input.txt`).
2. It builds a Markov chain by analyzing the sequence of words.
3. It then generates new text by predicting the next word based on the current word(s).
